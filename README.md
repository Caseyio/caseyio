### About Me

I'm a former Amazon and military operations leader pivoting into data analytics and machine learning. I bring 10+ years of experience building teams, optimizing systems, and driving strategic decisions — now powered by Python, R, and real-world data.

I’m currently completing the Google Data Analytics Certificate and have recently built full-scale analytics and ML projects covering supply chain optimization and predictive modeling. I enjoy tackling messy data, building sharp visualizations, and delivering insights that drive action.
