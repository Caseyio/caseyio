### About Me

I'm a former Amazon and military operations leader pivoting into **data analytics and machine learning**. I bring 10+ years of experience building teams and driving high-stakes decisions â€” now powered by Python, R, and real-world data.

I've completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate and recently delivered full-scale analytics and ML projects in supply chain optimization, federal Health IT bidding, and insurance cost modeling. I love transforming messy data into meaningful, strategic insights.

### ðŸš€ Featured Projects

#### [Federal Health IT Bid Prediction](https://github.com/caseyio/federal-bid-prediction)
> *Analytics case study aligned to federal capture roles like DLH's Capture Manager I*

- Built a bid prediction model using 43,000+ historical contract awards (USAspending.gov)
- Combined R (data prep) and Python (XGBoost, SHAP, PDP++) for predictive modeling
- Deployed 2 Streamlit apps for real-world use by capture and proposal teams

#### [Supply Chain Delivery Prediction](https://github.com/caseyio/supply-chain-capstone)
> *Capstone project using classification to predict supply chain disruptions*

- Cleaned and transformed 10K+ rows using R (`dplyr`, `readr`)
- Built binary classification models (LogReg, Decision Tree, XGBoost)
- Visualized key insights with `ggplot2` and Python dashboards  
  âž¤ [Kaggle Notebook]([https://www.kaggle.com/code/your-kaggle-notebook-link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/caseyortiz/supply-chain-delivery-analysis-r-python))
