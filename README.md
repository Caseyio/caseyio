I'm a former Amazon and military operations leader pivoting into data analytics and machine learning. I bring 10+ years of experience in leading teams, optimizing systems, and driving outcomes — now re-focused through the lens of data. I'm currently completing the Google Data Analytics Certificate and have recently built end-to-end analytics and modeling projects using Python, R, SQL, and visualization tools.
